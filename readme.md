# Eco Whisper

**Eco Whisper** is a visually immersive web experience focused on sustainability and eco-awareness. Built with smooth animations, magnetic image effects, and a soft aesthetic, this project demonstrates how modern front-end tools can create meaningful digital storytelling.

## Features
- Smooth scrolling experience using **Locomotive Scroll**
- Magnetic image effect and mouse follower with **Shery.js**
- Scroll-based animations powered by **GSAP**
- High-quality responsive image layouts
- Center-aligned navigation with interactive links
- Embedded video and animated banner sections

## How It Works

- **Locomotive Scroll** enables inertia-based smooth scrolling and subtle parallax effects.  
- **GSAP** animates elements such as text, images, and buttons with precise control over timing and easing.  
- **Shery.js** adds dynamic mouse follower and magnet effects that respond to cursor movement, creating an interactive feel.  
- The layout uses CSS Flexbox and positioning for flexibility and responsiveness.  
- Fonts are loaded using `@font-face` for consistent typography across browsers.


## Benefits

- Enhances user engagement with intuitive and interactive visual feedback.  
- Improves content presentation through smooth animation and clean design.  
- Boosts performance with optimized animation libraries.  
- Easy to customize and extend with minimal dependencies.


## How to Use

1. **Download or clone** the project repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).  
3. Ensure that GSAP, Locomotive Scroll, and shery.js scripts are included for full functionality.  
4. Customize images, text, and styles in the HTML and CSS files to fit your brand.  
5. Replace placeholder images and videos with your own assets.  
6. Adjust animation timings and effects via GSAP and shery.js configuration for personalized behavior.
